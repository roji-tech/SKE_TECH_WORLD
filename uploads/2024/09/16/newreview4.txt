MAJOR issues to address before merging PR

- Layout on your design has 2 cards by each other with huge space in between: https://prnt.sc/M0zOr8d_zWw6
- Breakpoint for Tablet (which is meant to show mobile design) is showing desktop design thus making it not responsible : https://prnt.sc/xyH09vnsKwJy
